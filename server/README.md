# Node Server Setup Instructions

This guide will walk you through the steps required to set up and run a Node.js server.

## Prerequisites
Ensure that you have Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed on your system. You can download and install them from Node.js official website.

## Setup Steps

### Step 1: Navigate to Server Directory
Open your terminal or command prompt and change the directory to the server folder.
``cd server``

### Step 2: Install Dependencies
Install the necessary npm packages defined in the package.json file.
``npm install``

### Step 3: Set Up Environment Variables
Create a .env file in the root of the server directory. Copy the contents from the .env.example file into this new .env file.
You can then edit the .env file with your specific configurations

### Step 4: Start the Server
Run the server using nodemon. Ensure that the npm start script is properly set up in your package.json file.
``npm start``

## Additional Information
The npm start script should be defined in your package.json file and typically is set to start the server with nodemon for development purposes.
If you encounter any issues, make sure that all environment variables in the .env file match your local setup.

## Support
For additional help or questions, refer to the Node.js and npm documentation or the documentation of any other packages you're using.
